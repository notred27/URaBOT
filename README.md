# URaBot



**A Chrome extension that provides real-time bot detection for Twitter (a.k.a. X).**



## Introduction

With the recent rise in artificially generated content, social media websites have been overrun with bots. This poses
a threat as these bots are known to spread dangerous information and detract from a userâ€™s online experience. Previous 
work has applied deep-learning techniques such as MLPs, SVMs, and random forests to features generated by asocial media 
user with high accuracy. More recently, transformer encoders have also been used with high levels of accuracy. However,
despite this research, there is still a lack of user-friendly bot detectors for many social media sites. Furthermore,
sites like Twitter (a.k.a. X) that employ built-in bot detectors often still let through large amounts
of artificially generated content. Through our work, we introduce URaBot: an application that operates in real-time
to detect bot-generated content on the browser version of Twitter. Our application consists of fine-tuned deep learning 
classifiers (MLP, DeBERTa, distilBERT), and a Chromium extension that can access our model and make corresponding changes to 
HTML in the browser.


## Features


## Installing the Application

### Loading the Application:
The base Chrome extension can be enabled by downloading the [Extension](Extension) directory and loading it as an **unpacked extension** at [<nobr>chrome://extensions/</nobr>](chrome://extensions/). Ensure that `Developer mode` has been enabled on this page. URaBOT should then appear as an installed extension on this page.

> For more help, check out additional information about loading a custom extension [here.](https://knowledge.workspace.google.com/kb/load-unpacked-extensions-000005962)


### Locally Hosting the API:

After the Chrome extension has been installed, you must locally host the API on your own machine. This is done with a python Flask server.

First, ensure that all of the requirements from `requirements.txt` are met. This can be done with pip and the following command:
```bash
    pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Then, navigate into the [API](API) directory and run the following Python script:
```bash
    python -m flask run
```


After this script, the server should be running, and you can enable the extension through its pop-up menu by clicking the extension badge.

You can additionally adjust the environmental variables found in the [.env](API/.env) to run a specific version of our model, or enable Platt Scaling. The Hugging Face labels for our models are:

- URaBOT2024/debertaV3_FullFeature

- URaBOT2024/debertaV3xsmall_FullFeature

- URaBOT2024/distilledbert_FullFeature

## Limitations



# Additional Training Information

The remaining information is not crucial for running the application, but instead documents how our models were trained and calibrated.

### Dataset:

- [HF Human vs Bot Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/airt-ml/twitter-human-bots): A dataset containing over **21,450** English tweets which are labeled as either a human or a bot.

### Encoder Models:

- [microsoft/deberta-v3-base](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-v3-base): The base version of Microsoft's DebertaV3

- [MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-xsmall-mnli-fever-anli-ling-binary](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-xsmall-mnli-fever-anli-ling-binary): A small version of DebertaV3 that has been fine-tuned for binary classification

- [distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased): A small BERT model intended for fine-tuning on sequence classification that is not case-sensitive

## Methods

## Tasks
**Main Tasks**
- [x] ~~Gather and pre-process data~~
- [x] ~~Build base models~~
- [x] ~~Test metrics on models and fine-tune (confidence intervals)~~
- [x] ~~Perform Platt-Scaling to calibrate our models~~
- [x] ~~Deploy models in API endpoint~~
- [x] ~~Build extension base~~
- [x] ~~Build RESTful API endpoint~~


**Future Tasks**
- [ ] Extend functionality to other social media sites (Instagram, BlueSky, Facebook, etc.)
- [ ] Permanently host API endpoint

> Slow API hosted at https://huggingface.co/spaces/mreidy3/URaBot
- [ ] Prevent duplicate tweets from being processed on this endpoint (and only allow 200 psudo id's to be stored on the endpoint)

- [ ] Create an adjusted version of the extension to run on Mozilla (Firefox)
- [ ] Create an option for users to report AI-generated content to create future datasets
- [ ] Extend models for AI-image classification
